# Planetary-Rover-Navigation-AI
This project involves an AI-powered simulation designed for the navigation of planetary rovers. It implements and compares various pathfinding algorithms, including Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Uniform Cost Search (UCS), Greedy Search, and A*, to achieve efficient route planning on a simulated planetary surface.
